# Robust Conditional GAN
Chainer implementation of the paper Robust Conditional GAN
https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byg0DsCqYQ
	

To train the network, e.g. with cgan, you can call it like this: 
``` 
python jobs/rocgan/train_mn.py '--config jobs/rocgan/iclr_5layer_cgan.yml' 
```

The results are improved over the original ICLR publication; those results and
pretrained files correspond to the journal version of the code (currently under
review).

Tested with chainer=4.0.0, chainercv=0.9.0 on a Linux machine.
The code is highly influenced from [1].
